# 🌌 Faculty of Exoplanets 1

### 🚀 Overview
**Faculty of Exoplanets 1** is an innovative educational and research platform that empowers scientists, researchers, and students to explore **exoplanets** using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.

Our project is inspired by NASA’s open-source exoplanet datasets and combines data from three space telescopes — **TESS**, **Kepler**, and **K2** — each with its own dedicated AI model.  
We also developed a **fourth AI model** that predicts whether a discovered planet could be **habitable** or not. 🌍

### 🧠 Challenge Background
Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered through data collected by various space-based missions — but most of these discoveries were made **manually**.  
With the advancement of AI/ML, our mission was to **automate the discovery process**, allowing intelligent models to analyze massive datasets and accurately identify exoplanets.

### 💡 Our Idea: *Faculty of Exoplanets 1*
We imagined a **virtual faculty** where researchers and learners can master the art of exoplanet exploration through AI.

We created **three AI models** (representing the telescopes TESS, Kepler, and K2), and each of them functions like a *course* where users can:
- Upload their own data and get predictions (Planet / Candidate / Not a Planet)
- Retrain the AI model with custom datasets
- Predict a single planet and view the probability score
- Access detailed dashboards for advanced analysis

---

### 🧑‍🚀 Two Learning Modes
1. **Researcher Mode** – Provides full analytical access for scientists to train and analyze complex data.  
2. **Student Mode** – Simplified explanations of dataset columns to help learners understand the science behind each telescope.

---

### 🌍 Habitability Prediction Model
In addition to the three telescope models, we built a **fourth model** that predicts whether an exoplanet is potentially **habitable**.  
This model analyzes planetary conditions and provides a probability score indicating suitability for life.

---

### 💻 Our Two Websites
We developed two interactive platforms:
1. **Learning Platform** – for exploring and understanding how to work with data from the three telescopes (TESS, Kepler, K2).  
2. **Habitability Platform** – for predicting whether planets could support life.
